Welcome to the RoseWheel Project !

Rosewheel is a self-balancing vehicle developped by 4 students of
robotics & embedded systems at Télécom ParisTech, a french engineering
school. It can be remotely controlled by an Android phone using
BlueTooth, and the phone may be used as a dashboard when driving the
vehicle. For more information about this project check our website:
RoseWheel.free.fr

* The PCB files are given in the "hardware" folder (hint: read the Makefile)
* To program the microcontrollers you may use an Olimex ARM jtag probe
* The compiler can be found at http://rosewheel.free.fr/arm-none-eabi.tgz
* to program the microcontrollers use the following command: make flash

Enjoy !
